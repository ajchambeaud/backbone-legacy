## Backbone Legacy App

The purpose of this project is to review some concepts of Backbone, as I'm working on a migration from Backbone to React. This application is bootstraped with create-react-app, using webpack, babel, es6 and all the fancy stuff... but is made with Backbone, jquery, Handlebars and other not so fancy tools.

## Run the app

`yarn start`
